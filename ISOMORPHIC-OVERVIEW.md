# Isomorphic application with React/Redux

So I wanted to build an isomorphic/universal web-application.  
This will be a long document about the *how* and the *why*.
The web-app was greatly influenced by this [Viktor Turskyi's post](http://blog.koorchik.com/isomorphic-react/).

Unlike this article, I won't produce here any code example.
I will try to focus on how different piece of code put together will solve building an universal applications problems.

## about the API

The web-application will interact with an API (`packages/api`) which will not be detailed here.
The only thing we need to know about the API is that:

- It's a REST like API (uses only GET & POST)
- Communicate with JSON
- Authenticate with a JSON Web Token (JWT) 

this document will __only focus__ on the `packages/web-app` folder

## prerequisite

You should have some notions with:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) 
  - what is a [Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
  - what is a [High-Order Component (HoC)](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) 
  - what is a [store](https://redux.js.org/basics/store)
  - what is an [action](https://redux.js.org/basics/actions)
  - what is a [reducer](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers)
- Some javascript tooling:
  - [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for bundling our application
  - [BabelJs](http://babeljs.io/) for converting [React jsx](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) code to plain javascript

## supported features & Tech

### reasons & Features

I make this universal application to learn more about React.

- I wanted to know how things work, so I didn't use any frameworks like [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) or [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) that will build things for me that I don't truly understand.
- I also wanted to make an exhaustive application: not a TODO example

In order to make it the most *real life* example this web-app will:

- mutualise all the code we can
- support authentication
- support Internationalization (i18n)
- be testable (even if there isn't as much tests that I wanted ðŸ˜¨)
- should work even without JS in the browser
  - I believe in progressive enhancement 
  - while developing, this allowed me to make API POST request without taking care about the redux actions.  
    Those can be handled in a second time.
  - I will use `browser cookie` to store the JWT.  
    It's the only way to store informations on the browser without relying on Javascript.

### tech

__React library__, among others, is a great way to __ensure__ that __our applications is perfectly in sync with our__  application __state__.
So we can rely on it to __always render the proper thing__ depending on the route/user actions/API queries.  
Thus, we will omit this part from this document (*i.e.* considering that changing the route/state will always render the right HTML)

Here are all the main modules used: 

- *views* â€“ [React 16.3](https://reactjs.org/)
- *router* 
  - [React router 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) 
  - [react-router-config 1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-config) for the universal support
- *application state* 
  - [redux 4](https://redux.js.org/)
  - [redux thunk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk) for a better handling of asynchronous actions
  - [react redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) for a better integration with React
- *server* â€“ [Koa 2](http://koajs.com/)

## code mutualization

As for the version 1.1.0:  

| front  | server  | shared front/client |
|   ---: |    ---: |                ---: |
| 36 loc | 279 loc | 6476 loc            |
| 1%     | 4%      | 95%                 |

I don't expect this repartition to change much with futur versions.  
It should be: 

- more & more code in shared code
- some small additions in server code (mainly for proxying POST fallback)

## building the applications

Using React with [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) make the code easier to write and to maintain so:

- we will need a building step to convert JSX to regular JS
- I used the most popular solution right now: [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/)/[Babel 7](http://babeljs.io/)
- since we have a build step, we can also:
  - use [ES2015 modules](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-modules-in-depth)
  - import our `scss` files directly in the components. 
    That really __helps me separate__ concerns about __what a Component__ should __do and how is it displayed__
    and __I really liked to have the styles living next to my markup__
- I didn't want any `@babel/register` in my server code, because it might have performance cost so:
  __build also the server code with webpack__

### server

- don't want to bundle the `node_modules`: they are already accessible in nodeJS environment 
  â†’ done with [webpack-node-externals](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-node-externals)
- want to always have access of source-map
  â†’ done with the the [webpack banner-plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/banner-plugin/) and the [source-map-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support) module
- ignore `.scss` requires
  â†’ done with [babel-plugin-transform-require-ignore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-require-ignore)
  __lesson learn: use babel to transform your code before bundling it with webpack__ 

### client

- want to bundle the `node_modules` in a separate file
  â†’ done with [webpack split-chunks-plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/)
- want to bundle `.scss` in a `.css` separate file
  â†’ done with [webpack extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extract-text-webpack-plugin)
  working in my case but should migrate to [webpack mini-css-extract-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mini-css-extract-plugin) (here is [why](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin/issues/749#issuecomment-374549467))


### sharing the configuration

I use to manage my server configuration with [rc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc).  
I wanted to keep it that way but an isomorphic configuration [comes with some challenge](http://blog.koorchik.com/isomorphic-react/#Isomorphic_configuration).

To keep it versatile, I wanted to pass my configuration down to the client like this:

```
rc â†’ server â†’ client
```

Unlike Viktor Turskyi's solution, I replaced the config import with specific serve/client files.
__This prevents mixing ES modules with Node's CommonJS modules syntax__

â†’ done with 
(normal-module-replacement-plugin)[https://webpack.js.org/plugins/normal-module-replacement-plugin/]

#### server

```js
export { default } from '../server/config'
```

#### client

```js
export default window.__CONFIG__
```

where `window.__CONFIG__` is passed by the server

#### during test

[AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) is used for testing.  
By default it uses babel to convert JSX. So I tried to keep it that way so â†’ no Webpack.
This will make it easier to require a single component and test it.

So I just use the use my configuration entry point as the test configuration: no need to replace it with webpack!  
I use the same babel configuration than the server, to prevent including the SCSS ðŸ˜€

## Application flow between server/client

This is how the app behave from the __first render__ made by the __server__ to the __subsequent client handling__

Here is a little bit of explanation:

- __symbols__
  - <img alt="the cookie symbol" src="assets/cookie-symbol.svg" width="16" /> represents a cookie either read from a server request, or from the browser
  - <img alt="the JWT symbol" src="assets/jwt-symbol.svg" width="16" /> represents a JWT which will be used for authentication between our web-application and the API
  - arrows between them represent reading/writing from/into the cookie
- __REACT-ROUTER__ will mutualise all our pages routes in GET
  - when __no JS__ we support GET/POST routes that aren't meant to display a page will be manually proxied to the API 
    this is done in the `server/routing-api-backup.js`
- __REDUX__ will maintain our app state
  - I uses the [duck convention](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) to organize the code
  - We will define in some `redux actions` the API calls
- __ISO-FETCH__ is a small wrapper around [isomorphic-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isomorphic-fetch)
  - it will handle any Fetch request to the API
  - when running on the client it can read the browser's cookie
  - when running on the server the cookie content will be provided by the server
