# Isomorphic application with React/Redux

So I wanted to build an isomorphic/universal web-application.  
This will be a long document about the *how* and the *why*.
The web-app was greatly influenced by this [Viktor Turskyi's post](http://blog.koorchik.com/isomorphic-react/).

Unlike this article, I won't produce here any code example.
I will try to focus on how different piece of code put together will solve building an universal applications problems.

## about the API

The web-application will interact with an API (`packages/api`) which will not be detailed here.
The only thing we need to know about the API is that:

- It's a REST like API (uses only GET & POST)
- Communicate with JSON
- Authenticate with a JSON Web Token (JWT) 

this document will __only focus__ on the `packages/web-app` folder

__Why no GraphQL?__

[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) seems a nice tech, but I simply didn't have time to dig into it.

## prerequisite

You should have some notions with:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) 
  - what is a [Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
  - what is a [High-Order Component (HoC)](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) 
  - what is a [store](https://redux.js.org/basics/store)
  - what is an [action](https://redux.js.org/basics/actions)
  - what is a [reducer](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers)
- Some javascript tooling:
  - [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for bundling our application
  - [BabelJs](http://babeljs.io/) for converting [React jsx](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) code to plain javascript

## supported features & Tech

### reasons & Features

I make this universal application to learn more about React.

- I wanted to know how things work, so I didn't use any frameworks like [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) or [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) that will build things for me that I don't truly understand.
- I also wanted to make an exhaustive application: not a TODO app example.
  There are plenty of those already, It's good to begin with but whenever you want to build something more, you're most of the time facing a wallâ€¦

In order to make it the most *real life* example this web-app will:

- mutualise all the code we can
- support authentication
- support Internationalization (i18n)
- be testable (even if there isn't as much tests that I wanted ðŸ˜¨)
- should work even without JS in the browser
  - I believe in progressive enhancement 
  - while developing, this allowed me to make API POST request without taking care about the redux actions.  
    Those can be handled in a second time.
  - I will use `browser cookie` to store the JWT.  
    It's the only way to store informations on the browser without relying on Javascript.
    Sadly a browser without JS & cookie is doomed ðŸ˜”

### tech

__React library__, among others, is a great way to __ensure__ that __our applications is perfectly in sync with our__  application __state__.
So we can rely on it to __always render the proper thing__ depending on the route/user actions/API queries.  
Thus, we will omit this part from this document (*i.e.* considering that changing the route/state will always render the right HTML)

Here are all the main modules used: 

- *views* â€“ [React 16.3](https://reactjs.org/)
- *router* 
  - [React router 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) 
  - [react-router-config 1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-config) for the universal support
- *application state* 
  - [redux 4](https://redux.js.org/)
  - [redux thunk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk) for a better handling of asynchronous actions
  - [react redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) for a better integration with React
- *server* â€“ [Koa 2](http://koajs.com/) (see [this post](https://hiswe.github.io/2018/07-from-express-to-koa/) about why I chose Koa)

## code mutualization

As for the version 1.1.0:  

| front  | server  | shared front/client |
|   ---: |    ---: |                ---: |
| 36 loc | 279 loc | 6476 loc            |
| 1%     | 4%      | 95%                 |

<img alt="lines of code repartition pie chart" src="assets/loc-chart.svg" width="320" />

I don't expect this repartition to change much with futur versions.  
It should be: 

- more & more code in shared code
- some small additions in server code (mainly for proxying POST fallback)

## building the applications

Using React with [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) make the code easier to write and to maintain so:

- a building step is required to convert JSX to regular JS
- the most popular solution right now is the couple [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)/[Babel](http://babeljs.io/)
  - Webpack is a the version 4 since a while
    It promises to be simpler, but I found myself still digging a lot to make it work as expected
    [ParcelJs](https://parceljs.org/) seems very promising but is in my opinion to young. I'll wait a little bit for more documentation & tutorials 
  - as the latest version of Ava use babel 7, I picked it for my build process also.
    At this time (may 2018) it's in `beta 46` ðŸ˜³ and working perfectly
    I can't thank enough all the people contributing to this project and I really hope that the final release will come soon
- since we have a build step, why not
  - use [ES2015 modules](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-modules-in-depth)
  - import our `scss` files directly in the components. 
    That really __helps separate concerns about what a Component should do and how is it displayed__
    Also it will ma it easy to __keep the styles next to the markup__
- I didn't want any `@babel/register` in my server code because it might have performance cost so:
  __build also the server code with webpack__
  And that will also allow me to replace some files when needed

### server

- don't want to bundle the `node_modules`: they are already accessible in nodeJS environment 
  â†’ done with [webpack-node-externals](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-node-externals)
- want to always have access of source-map
  â†’ done with the the [webpack banner-plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/banner-plugin/) and the [source-map-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support) module
- ignore `.scss` requires
  â†’ done with [babel-plugin-transform-require-ignore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-require-ignore)
  __lesson learn: use babel to transform your code before bundling it with webpack__ 

### client

- want to bundle the `node_modules` in a separate file
  â†’ done with [webpack split-chunks-plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/)
- want to bundle `.scss` in a `.css` separate file
  â†’ done with [webpack extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extract-text-webpack-plugin)
  working in my case but should migrate to [webpack mini-css-extract-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mini-css-extract-plugin) (here is [why](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin/issues/749#issuecomment-374549467))


### sharing the configuration

I use to manage my server configuration with [rc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc).  
I wanted to keep it that way but an isomorphic configuration [comes with some challenge](http://blog.koorchik.com/isomorphic-react/#Isomorphic_configuration).

To keep it versatile, I wanted to pass my configuration down to the client like this:

```
rc â†’ server â†’ client
```

Unlike Viktor Turskyi's solution, I replaced the config import with specific server/client files.
__This prevents mixing ES modules with Node's CommonJS modules syntax__

â†’ done with 
(normal-module-replacement-plugin)[https://webpack.js.org/plugins/normal-module-replacement-plugin/]

#### server

```js
export { default } from '../server/config'
```

#### client

```js
export default window.__CONFIG__
```

where `window.__CONFIG__` is passed by the server

#### during test

[AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) is used for testing.  
By default it uses babel to convert JSX. So I tried to keep it that way so â†’ no Webpack.
This will make it easier to require a single component and test it.

So I just use the use my configuration entry point as the test configuration: no need to replace it with webpack!  
I use the same babel configuration than the server, to prevent including the SCSS ðŸ˜€

## about server rendering

In order to be able to __support a no-JS environment__, and to make our __first display quicker__ we will make the first render on the server.

For this we need:

1. grab the right components to render (using the [React methods for server rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html))
    a non exiting route means rendering the 404 component
2. make sure that the components have the right datas to begin with.
3. pass everything to the client
4. after that the client will initialize and run as a [single page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)

## application flow summary

This is how the app behave from the __first render__ made by the __server__ to the __subsequent client handling__

Here is a little bit of explanation:

- __symbols__
  - <img alt="the cookie symbol" src="assets/cookie-symbol.svg" width="16" /> represents a cookie either read from a server request, or from the browser
  - <img alt="the JWT symbol" src="assets/jwt-symbol.svg" width="16" /> represents a JWT which will be used for authentication between our web-application and the API
  - arrows between them represent reading/writing from/into the cookie
- __REACT-ROUTER__ will mutualise all our pages routes in GET
  - when __no JS__ we support GET/POST routes that aren't meant to display a page will be manually proxied to the API 
    this is done in the `server/routing-api-backup.js`
- __REDUX__ will maintain our app state
  - I uses the [duck convention](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) to organize the code
  - We will define in some `redux actions` the API calls
- __ISO-FETCH__ is a small wrapper around [isomorphic-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isomorphic-fetch)
  It will handle any Fetch request to the API
  Keep in mind that:
  - on the __server__: the cookie content will be provided by the server
  - on the __client__: it can read the browser's cookie content by itself

## routing with React-Router & Redux

### what is React-router

[React-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) is, I think, the most common routing solution for React.
They have recently updated their library to the version 4, so a lot of tutorials found online were outdated by using the previous versions ðŸ˜¶

There is a huge [shift of philosophy](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/guides/philosophy) between the previous versions and this one.
They call it *dynamic routing* and it's very different from the classical way.

### interfacing with a server

To interface nicely with our Koa server we need something that:

1. is more traditional & plays well with a server routing
2. can be easily shared between the server/client

For that they have made a package named [react-router-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-config). 
It's still in beta but is working as expected for me.

react router config mainly does 3 things: 

- a way to define a route configuration 
- a method to __retrieve the component that match the route__
- give a way for the router to give back informations to the server (like not found & redirection)

#### get Redux Actions from components

Like seen before, with react-router-config __it's easy to get which components to render.__

But we need a way to tell our server which datas those components needs.  
We will rely on Redux to maintain a coherent state.

What we __need is redux actions__ that we __dispatch to our store__ and redux will do his job. 

But because it's an universal application:

- on the __server__ we will need the __actions to be called before instantiating our components__ 
    â†’ this is solved by using a [static method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/static) on our components
- on the __client__ we will need the __actions to be called in [componentDidMount()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount)__
- on __first rendering__ we must __prevent the client to call the componentDidMount() actions__
    Calling them twice won't have a lot of side effects but making the same set of requests is inefficientâ€¦

the solution came again from [Viktor Turskyi's post](http://blog.koorchik.com/isomorphic-react/#Data_fetching) about data fetching.

We need to make a [HoC](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) to take care of this.

It will:

1. take in input a `component` and an array of redux actions (`actionsCreators`)
2. always add the authentication action
3. return the `component` in the `render()` passing in any `props`
4. for the __server__: expose a static method named `fetchData` which will `dispatch` any `actions` of the `actionsCreators` array
5. for the __client__: call `fetchData` in `componentDidMount`
6. prevent the first call of `componentDidMount` (with a module variable named `SKIP_FIRST_COMPONENTDIDMOUNT`)
